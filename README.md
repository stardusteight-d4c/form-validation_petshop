When fetching the location information from the ViaCEP API we call the fetch() function passing two properties. 
One of them is the url that says where we should make the request and another property that is an object with options:
  
`method: 'GET'` is the type of request that will be made.
  
`mode: 'cors'` indicates that communication will be made between different applications.

`headers: {'content-type': 'application/json;charset=utf-8'}` tells us how we want to receive information from the API.
